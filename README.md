## About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Civil Engineering at the University of Memphis, specializing in **stochastic hydrology**, **meteorology**, and **engineering designs**. My PhD research aims to enhance the understanding and modeling of extreme rainfall, particularly short-duration for **urban infrastructure design** and **climate resilience**.

## 🧪 Current Work & Research Highlights

- 📦 [**nsEVDx**](https://github.com/Nischalcs50.nsEVDx) – Open-source Python package for modeling non-stationary extreme value distributions  
- 📊 Trend detection in short-duration rainfall extremes using **Bayesian** and **frequentist** nonstationary GEV models  
- 🌦️ Integrating **Remote Sensing** and **Transformers** for drought and flood prediction

- 🔍 **Neighborhood-based Trend Detection**  
  A novel spatial method to detect nonstationarity in rainfall extremes *(Submitted)*

- 📈 **Effect of Minimum Interevent Time (MIT)**  
  Evaluating how MIT choices impact regional DDF curves *(Submitted)*

- 🎯 **Spatially Independent Maxima Extraction**  
  Using radar and storm motion to extract independent rainfall extremes *(AGU 2024, manuscript in prep)*

- ⛅ **Rainfall Disaggregation with Transformers**  
  Disaggregating daily rainfall to sub-daily (n-minute) using deep learning *(In preparation)*

- 🛰️ **Impact of Spatio-temporal Resolution of Rain Gauge Network in DDF Values**  
  Studying how spatial/temporal gauge density influences DDF estimation *(AGU & ASCE-EWRI 2024)*

- 🏙️ **Urban Flood Modeling**  
  Simulated Flood Events in South Memphis, historically undreserved community in Memphis, using 2018 Germantown storm in PCSWMM; created flood inundation maps & animations for city planning

  Participated in community meetings in South memphis and informed the community about the flood risk enhancing their preparedness
