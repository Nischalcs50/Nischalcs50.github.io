## About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Civil Engineering at the University of Memphis, specializing in **stochastic hydrology**, **meteorology**, and **engineering designs**. My PhD research aims to enhance the understanding and modeling of extreme rainfall, particularly short-duration for **urban infrastructure design**, **climate resilience** and **flood risk management**.

## 🧪 Current Work & Research Highlights

- 📦 [**nsEVDx**](https://github.com/Nischalcs50.nsEVDx) – Open-source Python package for modeling non-stationary extreme value distributions  
- 📊 Trend detection in short-duration rainfall extremes using **Bayesian** and **frequentist** nonstationary GEV models  
- 🌦️ Integrating **Remote Sensing** and **Transformers** for drought and flood prediction

- 🔍 **Neighborhood-based Trend Detection**  
  A novel spatial method to detect nonstationarity in rainfall extremes *(Submitted)*

- 📈 **Effect of Minimum Interevent Time (MIT)**  
  Evaluating how MIT choices impact regional DDF curves *(Submitted)*

- 🎯 **Extracting Spatially Independent Regional Partial Duration Series**  
  Using radar and storm motion to extract independent rainfall extremes *(AGU 2024, manuscript in prep)*

- ⛅ **Rainfall Disaggregation with Transformers**  
  Disaggregating daily rainfall to sub-daily (n-minute) using deep learning *(In preparation)*

- 🛰️ **Impact of Spatio-temporal Resolution of Rain Gauge Network in Regional DDF Values**  
  Studying how spatial/temporal gauge density influences DDF estimation *(AGU & ASCE-EWRI 2024)*

- 🏙️ **Urban Flood Modeling**  
  Simulated flood events in South Memphis, a historically underserved community, using the 2018 Germantown storm in PCSWMM; created flood inundation maps & animations for city planning use  

  Participated in 3 community meetings, informing over 120 residents about localized flood risks and preparedness strategies, contributing to more informed local planning discussions


- 📉 **Bias Correction & Downscaling of GCMs**  
  Compared statistical methods in Chilean basins under climate change scenarios

- 🌱 **Green Infrastructure Siting with ML**  
  Applied machine learning to locate optimal GSI sites using hydrologic connectivity metrics
