## About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Civil Engineering at the University of Memphis, specializing in **stochastic hydrology**, **meteorology**, and **engineering designs**. My PhD research aims to enhance the understanding and modeling of extreme rainfall, particularly short-duration for **urban infrastructure design**, **climate resilience** and **flood risk management**.

## 🧪 Current Work & Research Highlights

- 📦 [**nsEVDx**](https://github.com/Nischalcs50/nsEVDx) – Open-source Python package for modeling non-stationary extreme value distributions  
- 📊 Trend detection in short-duration rainfall extremes using **Bayesian** and **frequentist** nonstationary GEV models  
- 🌦️ Integrating **Remote Sensing** and **Transformers** for drought and flood prediction

- 🔍 **Neighborhood-based Trend Detection**  
  A novel spatial method to detect nonstationarity in rainfall extremes *(Submitted)*

- 📈 **Effect of Minimum Interevent Time (MIT)**  
  Evaluating how MIT choices impact regional DDF curves *(Submitted)*

- 🎯 **Extracting Spatially Independent Regional Partial Duration Series**  
  Using radar and storm motion to extract independent rainfall extremes *(AGU 2024, manuscript in prep)*
