## About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Civil Engineering at the University of Memphis, specializing in **stochastic hydrology**, **meteorology**, and **engineering designs**. My PhD research aims to enhance the understanding and modeling of extreme rainfall, particularly short-duration for **urban infrastructure design** and **climate resilience**.

---

## Current Work

- 📦 **nsEVDx** – An open-source Python package for modeling non-stationary extreme value distributions  
- 📊 Exploring **Bayesian** and **frequentist** methods for trend detection in short-duration rainfall extremes  
- 🌦️ Integrating **radar data**, **SMAP**, and **machine learning (Transformers)** for drought and flood prediction  
- 📍 Special focus on **Southeastern U.S.** and **Nepalese mountain regions**
-
