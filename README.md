## About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Civil Engineering at the University of Memphis, specializing in **hydrology**, **extreme rainfall analysis**, and **non-stationary extreme value modeling**. My research aims to enhance the understanding and modeling of short-duration extreme rainfall, particularly for **urban infrastructure design** and **climate resilience**.

---

## Current Work

- 📦 **nsEVDx** – An open-source Python package for modeling non-stationary extreme value distributions  
- 📊 Exploring **Bayesian** and **frequentist** methods for trend detection in short-duration rainfall extremes  
- 🌦️ Integrating **radar data**, **SMAP**, and **machine learning (Transformers)** for drought and flood prediction  
- 📍 Special focus on **Southeastern U.S.** and **Nepalese mountain regions**

## Research Interests

- Non-stationary frequency analysis  
- Short-duration depth-duration-frequency (DDF) curves  
- Partial duration series and threshold selection  
- Spatio-temporal trend detection  
- Bayesian inference, MCMC, and copula modeling  
- Python tools for hydrologic modeling
